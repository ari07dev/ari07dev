- ⚡ Fun fact: Hot Reload: One of the standout features of Flutter is its "hot reload" capability.
- This allows developers to see the results of the latest changes they’ve made to the code almost instantly without restarting the whole app.
- This feature significantly speeds up the development process, making it more efficient and enjoyable for developers to experiment and iterate on their apps in real-time.
